I pulled the AntV site (**${ANTV_TITLE}**) and I’m ready to help.

**Next question (AutoUI):**
1) Which AntV package do you want? (G2 / G6 / X6 / L7 / S2)
2) What is the first chart you want on the landing page? (bar / line / pie / KPI cards / network)
3) Do you want it embedded in your **Vue** “coming soon” page, or a separate demo page?

Reply with (1)-(3) and I’ll give you the exact starter code.

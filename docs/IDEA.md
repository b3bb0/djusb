# CORE: Concept + Security

## Concept: 3 poles system
- 1 **static** pole as more front as possible
- 2 **dynamic** poles back of the vessel
- front swivel Y axis movement for use over 20 knots (optional)
- no modifications needed to boats (not even 1 screw)
- no power needed to be connected (self powered)

mecanical system to smooth possible gursts
installation using telescopi comprezzion bars
Material used: aluminium


## Security
The front pole is static, in case of failure if frint pole malfunction could damage people and boat

Diuble lock system on power-off (2 indipendent normally blocked sokutions):
- normally blocced engine
- vertical movemebt on a lead screw TR16×8 

reduntant sensors & fail safe constant checks

## Tl;DR
rear pole are static and have a big screa inside... on top there is a drill that screw in or out & make the bolt travel up or down based on what is needed

90% of code and components are checks and smoothening algoritms (and to self calubrate)

poles are hold with the same system the "pull up bar at your toilet door" holds your weight

the back poles don't go down, they hold up a hat in figerglass with all the systen inside, can be removed in 1 minutes.
